# Trading App project built from scratch 

##Build Built from scratch and manually installing node modules

This is a quick mock up of a trading web-app that I created.
To be able to run this build, navigate to the root folder and then in terminal, run <code>npm install</code>
Then after the install is complete, run <code>npm start</code>. 
This will build the app and then launch the view in your browser http://localhost:9000/ 

###About
The idea of this is to use react to get json data (locally) and disply on the app as well as render data from ana array by assiging variables to the imports and using the variables to reference and access desired data
