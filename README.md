# Trading App project built from scratch 

##Build Built from scratch and manually installing node modules

This is a quick mock up of a trading web-app that I created.
To be able to run this build, navigate to the root folder and then in terminal, run <code>npm install</code>
Then after the install is complete, run <code>npm start</code>. 
This will build the app and then launch the view in your browser http://localhost:9000/
